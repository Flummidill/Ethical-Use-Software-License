## About this License

The Ethical Use Software License (EUSL) is designed to promote freedom of learning, sharing, and improvement, while preventing exploitation through commercialization.
It ensures that Software remains public, transparent, and ethically used.

This license is ideal for developers who want their work to benefit others freely, without being turned into a product or service for profit.

## Why I Created this License

Many other Open-Source licenses allow corporations to profit from open-source work by adding monetisation or Premium Acess.


Therefore, I created the EUSL to ensure that:

- Software remains free and publicly accessible

- Developers are credited for their work

- No one can sell, resell, or monetize the project

- All changes are open and transparent

- The license and its intent remain intact across all forks


In short, this license reflects that:

‚ùå Any commercial or monetized use is prohibited

‚úÖ Open-Source use, modification, and redistribution is allowed

‚úÖ Attribution and a link to the original Project is required

‚úÖ Modifications must be clearly documented

üîí The License cannot be removed or changed

‚ö†Ô∏è No warranty or liability is included
