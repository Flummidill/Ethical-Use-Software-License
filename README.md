## About this License

The Ethical Use Software License (EUSL) is designed to promote freedom of learning, sharing, and improvement, while preventing exploitation through commercialization.
It ensures that Software remains public, transparent, and ethically used.

This license is ideal for developers who want their work to benefit others freely, without being turned into a product or service for profit.


## Why I Created this License

Many other Open-Source licenses allow corporations to profit from open-source work by adding monetisation or Premium Acess.


Therefore, I created the EUSL to ensure that:

- üåé Your Software remains free and publicly accessible

- üìú You are Credited for your Work

- üí∏ No one can sell, resell, or monetize your Project

- ‚úçÔ∏è All changes to your Work are Open and Transparent

- üí¨ The License and its intent remain intact across all forks of your Software

- ‚ö†Ô∏è No Warranty or Liability are included in yor Work
